    <p>Harry Potter and the
Goblet of fire
This book is an amazing book. I think I really like it. JK Rowling made this book by the way.
There is a new defense against the dark arts teacher in hogwarts. His name is Alastor moody also known by his popular name Mad eye moody. Turns out after the world cup mad eye, the real mad eye was kidnapped. While a death eater disguised his avatar and
became a teacher at Hogwarts . Mad eye put Harry's name in the goblet of fire. Dumbledore was rather confused by finding out that Harry's name was put in the goblet of fire as Harry is underage. Harry completed the first task with Hagrid's help which Moody suggested. The first task was getting the dragon's Golden egg. The second task was going underwater and saving our most important thing guarded by merman's. The Third task was getting the cup from completing a maze.When Harry and cedric touched the cup, it was a portkey which led to killing cedric by peter pettigrew also known as wormtail. Which left Harry traumatized and Voldemort comes back with his "loyal" death eaters. Harry won the cup and got 1000 galleons which Harry did not accept. Harry gave the money to Fred and George Weasley to start their joke shop. Rita Skeeter was making false, untruthful news because she was money hungry. Hermione Granger caught her sneaking in by becoming an animal and she was a false animagus. She put her in a jar and trapped her there forever. Harry and his friends wenk back for summer vacation and Harry had to stay with the dursleys.
